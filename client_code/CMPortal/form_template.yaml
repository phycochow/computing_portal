        Researchers facilliate the cardiomyocyte differentiation and maturation of human stem cells (hiPSC-CMs) through 2D and 3D culture protocols for diverse applications. These include studying disease mechanisms and human genetics to developing precision drugs. However, most maturation methods are used by a few research groups and their studies' findings are often not directly comparable. There has been a lack of protocol benchmarking and consolidation of over two decades of cardiac knowledge. Our study addresses these gaps by augmenting a robust feature selection approach for protocol optimisation. Through comprehensive statistical analyses and functional validation studies, we find distinctive variable panels that influence the physiological performance of hiPSC-CMs.

        ## About this Server

        ### What does the current dataset contain?

        This study builds on work published by Ewoldt et al., systematically analysing 300 studies focusing on maturation benchmarking for ventricular cardiomyocytes. The aim is to improve protocols for the generation of hiPSC-CMs to model cardiac development and diseases. Since most maturation protocols are developed internally in research groups and not appropriately cross-compared, there is insufficient data to identify protocol parameters that yield the best functional outcomes.

        ### Summary of Analyses
        - We performed data mining on 314 hiPSC-CM studies, resulting in data-driven recommendations to enhance protocol optimisation for physiological maturation of hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes.
        - For each maturation parameter, we evaluated protocol variables, such as the cell's genetic background, to assess their impact on hiPSC-CM functional parameters.
        - Additionally, we assessed their uniqueness, ensuring they are not technical artifacts arising from co-reporting bias in published studies.
        - We identified 15 significant panels of protocol variables enriched for functional outcomes.
        - Our results guided experimental validation of the outcome-affecting role of backbone media towards functional maturation and ischaemic modelling of hiPSC-CMs.

        ### What are the limitations?
        One of the key contributions of this study is its ability to overcome the near-incomparability of context-dependent hiPSC-CM protocols, revealing design-outcome associations. However, several limitations exist:

        - Ascertainment Bias:
          - While we have shown the dissimilarity of enrichments, they are based on the most reproduced study designs.
          - Emerging modifications that could improve protocols might not be identified due to limited representation.


        - Generalisation Challenges:
          - It is challenging to generalise the direct biological causality of molecular variables towards functional outcomes.
          - Some molecular variables may counteract others that inhibit maturation, and some are dependent on specific protocol variables.


        - Ordinal Relationships:
          - Tree models paired with one-hot encoding do not retain ordinal relationships between categories.
          - The original study characteristics might be used in the same path, potentially making the enrichment a technical artifact.
          - We account for this by introducing a novel bootstrapping-based technique to assign statistical significance.


        - Assay Design Differences:
          - The database may overlook critical differences between assay designs, such as the cellular complexity and nutrient requirements of 2D versus 3D culture models.
          - This may lead to contradictions in enrichment for maturation and modelling.
          - Merging 2D and 3D studies is a trade-off against the limited data size.


        Our quantitative analysis **minimises** these limitations and provides confidence values for statistical assessments. We acknowledge that these results are subject to change due to data availability and encourage users to upload their own protocols for database contribution and systematic comparison against similar studies.

        ## **Methods**

        ### 1. Database Expansion

        The foundational database was expanded with 14 additional studies utilising metabolic techniques aimed at cardiac maturation and disease modeling. Categories for cell line sex and ancestry were also added to promote equity and representation in hiPSC cardiac studies.

        ### 2. Entry Categorisation

        A flexible entry categorisation strategy was implemented to address feature cardinality and incorporate new biological annotations. Entries that are reported in less than 3 studies are classified as 'Specialised'. Together, this enhances protocol interpretability and comparability for future data submissions, leading to the benchmarking tool in this web portal.

        ### 3. Data Encoding and Assumptions

        One-hot encoding was applied to all categorised features. This is the ket step that takes advantage of informative missingness, which assumes that the absence of a protocol variable is an intentional decision that may impact a functional outcome. This encoding approach expanded the original database to encompass 314 published protocols and 441 features.

        ### 4. Feature Importance Analysis

        One-hot encoding was applied to all categorised features. This is the ket step that takes advantage of informative missingness, which assumes that the absence of a protocol variable is an intentional decision that may impact a functional outcome. This encoding approach expanded the original database to encompass 314 published protocols and 441 features.

        ### 5. Null Distribution Construction

        One-hot encoding was applied to all categorised features. This is the ket step that takes advantage of informative missingness, which assumes that the absence of a protocol variable is an intentional decision that may impact a functional outcome. This encoding approach expanded the original database to encompass 314 published protocols and 441 features.

        ### 6. Jaccard Index Analysis

        One-hot encoding was applied to all categorised features. This is the ket step that takes advantage of informative missingness, which assumes that the absence of a protocol variable is an intentional decision that may impact a functional outcome. This encoding approach expanded the original database to encompass 314 published protocols and 441 features.

        ### 7. Statistical Summary

        Hierarchical clustering of protocol parameters by statistical significance revealed distinct parameters associated with physiological maturation. This suggest the effects of most protocol paramters are not pleotropic. Additionally, the number of significant enrichments was found to correlate strongly with fold-change dissimilarity between significant and all protocol features. This affirms that our bootstrapping-based approach of feature enrichment results in less technical artifacts as more significant enrichments are found. At a high level, it means our enrichments are effectively capturing signals from diverse, multiple studies.

        Similarly, we constructed a null distribution based on random protocol variables matching the number of significant enrichments for the Jaccard dissimilarity analysis. All dissimilarity findings are significant except for Beat Rate (p-value=0.050).

        ### 8. Supplemental Analysis

        Further analyses included generating null distribution enrichment values using random forest models and performing bootstrapping to assess statistical significance.
